						And then Jon <a href="http://slides.com/jonhuber/deck/">set fire to a Django codebase</a> in order to refactor and improve it - showing us a few things not to do but also that it's always possible to get back to solid ground.
					</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Special Event</strong>:
            On August 7th Django core developer <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin">Andrew Godwin</a> dropped by the Code Shop to present his talk <em>Django's Migrations: A Retrospective</em> to an enthusiastic crowd of Django &amp; Python developers.
